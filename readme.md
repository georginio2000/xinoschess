# XINOSCHESS (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Zero knowledge, neural network based, chess engine being built from scratch.
Current status: compile run and play a chess game against yourself (check https://github.com/ikonomoug/XINOSCHESS for playing with an opponent).

## chessv2

Simulatss a chess game, used for the chess logic.

## cnn(Convolutional Neural Network):

Flexible cnn library ready to implement any desired network structure. 

## mcts(Monte Carlo Tree Search): 

The required logic for expanding the search tree in the best looking way (choosing the right moves to look in depth into).
