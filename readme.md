# chessv2: simulates a chess game

	FIXED -throws error in some edge cases(pawns reaching the edge and not promoting) FIXED
	DONE-fix edge cases DONE
	DONE-redifine class for const correctness and memory management DONE
	-fix errors in memory deallocation

cnn(convolutional neural network): currently the neural network is able to take board as input and output an evalutaion based on random weights
	-fix backpropagation
	-implement policy head

mcts(monte carlo tree search): basic structure is defined but does not work correct during tests(need to fix chess v2 edge cases first)
	DONE-fix backpropagation DONE
	-make functions to toggle between choosing move randomly and based on the evaluation network
